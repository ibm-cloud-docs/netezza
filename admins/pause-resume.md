# Pausing and resuming instances
{: #pauseresume}

When you pause {{site.data.keyword.netezza_full}} instances, you shut down and free up all of the compute resources that are associated with a specified {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} instance. Pausing instances helps to save on the service cost. You usually pause instances if no workload exists on them. After an instance is paused, your {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} service is not available for executing new workloads.

Resuming {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} instances is the reverse of the pausing operation. When you resume instances the necessary compute resources are reprovisioned, the {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} service is brought back online, and it is ready for executing new workloads.

You can launch pause/resume by using the {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} web console. Pause/resume can be performed by the platform owner, administrator and editor only. For more infomation, see [Managing IAM access for Netezza Performance Server](/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-iam-docs).

Depending on your requirements, you can also choose a scheduled pause/resume along with an on demand (ad hoc) pause/resume.
