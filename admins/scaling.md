# Scaling
{: #scaling-topic}

{{site.data.keyword.netezza_full}} offers the ability to independently scale your compute resources as needed. With {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} you can initiate scaling by using the web console. You can scale within the same workload contour.

Scaling is an online operation for read only queries where queries get paused during scaling and get resumed automatically after scaling is complete. You also have an option to schedule scaling along with starting an on demand (ad hoc) scaling.

You must have appropriate privileges to launch scaling. For more information, see [Managing IAM access for Netezza Performance Server](/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-iam-docs).
