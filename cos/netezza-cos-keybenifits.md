# Getting started
{: #netezzacosoverview}

## Availability
{: #avail}

COS is available for both new and existing customers on Netezza SaaS and BYOC/CVPC platforms.
Existing customers can configure COS after upgrading to a supported version.

## Deployment Behavior
{: #deplo_beh}

For new deployments, a dedicated COS bucket is automatically provisioned and assigned to the Netezza instance. Buckets are exclusive to each Netezza instance. No sharing between users or instances.
