# Overview
{: #netezzacosoverview}

With the introduction of Cloud Object Storage (COS) support, Netezza now offers a hybrid storage model, enabling customers to use both block storage and object storage for their workloads. This provides a cost-effective solution for managing cold and hot data, with table-level and database-level control over storage preferences.

## Key benefits
{: #key_benefits}

- Lower storage costs with object storage compared to traditional block storage.
- Granular control: Select storage type at the table or database level.
- Seamless integration with your existing Netezza cloud deployment.
- Improved scalability and flexibility.
