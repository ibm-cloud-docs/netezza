# Time travel
{: #timetravel}

Maintaining a time-based data support infrastructure might be expensive and complex.
With the technology preview of {{site.data.keyword.netezza_full}} time travel,
you can store, retrieve, and analyze historical data without additional application logic in your data (tables, schemas, and databases).

## Understanding time travel
{: #understandingtt}

This powerful tool comes in handy when you want to track the history of data changes or
reconstruct your data. For example, you can identify one of the following values, and many more:

- The price of an item during any specific current or historical period of time.
- The prices of stock that was used in a valuation or initial public offering three years ago.
- The financials according to due diligence at the time of a company merger.
- The number of cars that are rented out week over week.
- The purchaser that makes the most changes to quantity after an order is entered.
- The supplier that routinely offers a steeper discount than first indicated.


Common business uses for temporal tables:

**Conducting data audits**
You can do data forensics because time travel provides an audit trail.

**Changing dimensions**
With data warehouse systems, you can use time travel for attributes that change overtime through the normal course of business.
For example, personal information, medical records or credit information of the customer.

**Analyzing and calculating trends**
You can establish how data changes over time with the ongoing business activity,
and calculate trends in the way that data changes over time.

**Rebuilding data if inadvertent changes occur**
You can retrieve previous version of your data from the history table and insert
the old data back into the table.

**Reconstructing data**
You can reconstruct the state of the data as of any time in the past.

**Identifying differences**
You can identify differences in between two points in time of interest.

## Introducing time travel
{: #intrott}

By using {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} time travel, you can access historical data (for example, data that was changed or deleted)
at any point within a specified time.

With time travel, you can do the following tasks:

- Create a system-managed temporal table by specifying a data version retention time interval.
- Create or alter a schema with a retention time, which is to be inherited by tables that are created after a create or delete operation.
- Create or alter a database with a retention time, which is to be inherited by schemas that are created after a create or delete operation.
- Set or disable a default retention time at the system level, which is inherited by databases that are created after the system level default is set.
- View the retention time of a table, schema, database, or the system default.
- Query past data in a temporal table as of a point in time.
- Query past data in a temporal table over a range or period of time.
- Create or replace a view whose definition is a temporal query.


### Time travel SQL extensions
{: #sqltt}

### Data version retention interval (DATA_VERSION_RETENTION_TIME)
{: #retentiontt}

Data version retention time interval (retention time interval, retention interval)
specifies the maximum number of days that historical data in a temporal table is preserved
and visible to time travel queries. When you change data in a time travel (temporal) table,
{{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} preserves the state of the data before the modification so that you can do time travel operations.

You can set the retention interval property at table, schema, database, and system level.
By setting the value on a system, database, or schema, you do not have to set the property on many tables
if you want to have the same value on all of these tables.

You can set the retention interval to any value from 0 up to 92 days. When the retention interval ends,
your historical data is no longer available for querying and you cannot restore objects.

The default value at all levels is 0. A table with a 0 retention interval is not a temporal table
and does not support time travel queries.

If you set a retention interval of 0 days for an object, time travel is disabled for the object.


### Temporal tables
{: #temporaltablestt}

A temporal table is a table that has a specified, nonzero retention interval, and supports time travel queries.
Temporal tables provide a built-in support to access the data that is stored in a table at any point in time
rather than current data (current moment in time). The history of your data in the table is maintained and managed automatically.

At any specified time, a tableâ€™s retention interval start timestamp equals the current timestamp
(date/time, with microsecond granularity) minus the retention interval.

The retention interval of a temporal table is the period of time that starts at the retention start timestamp and has no defined end.

Tables with retention interval set to zero are not temporal.

**NOTE:** Netezza Performance Server supports only system-managed temporal tables.
A system-managed temporal table is a table that maintains historical versions of its rows.
Use a system-period temporal table to store current versions of your data.
The database transparently stores your updated and deleted data rows.
System-period tables are system-managed.
