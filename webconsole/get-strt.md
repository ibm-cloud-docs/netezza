# Getting started with the web console
{: #getstarted-console}

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
1. Go to **Resource list > Services and software**.
1. Select your **{{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}}** instance.  
    You are now on the service instance page.   
1. Select the **Manage** tab.
1. Click the **Web console** button to launch the web console.  
    Your credentials are available in the **Service credentials** section.
    
If you use private endpoints, use the IP address that is associated with the private endpoint that was created with the console resource ID or alias to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} web console on port 443.  

To form the web console URL from the private endpoint IP address, append the CRN name to it.  You can retrieve the CRN name from **Resource list > Services and software**.
For example: `https://<private endpoint IP>/#/?crn=CRN_NAME`

After you log in to the {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} web console, you are on the home page.

Choose a light mode or dark mode for a better web console experience.
