# Getting started with the web console
{: #getstarted-console}

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
1. Go to **Resource list > Services and software**.
1. Select your **{{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}}** instance.  
    You are now on the service instance page.   
1. Select the **Manage** tab.
1. Click the **Web console** button to launch the web console.  
1. Use the credentials that are available in the **Service credentials** section to log in.  

   If you use private endpoints, use the IP address that is associated with the private endpoint that was created with the console resource ID or alias to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} web console on port 443.  

   To form the web console URL, append the Cloud Resource Name (CRN) to the private endpoint IP address. For example: `https://<private endpoint IP>/#/?crn=CRN_NAME`.  

   To get the CRN:

   1. Log in to the IBM Cloud catalog.
   1. Go to **Resource list > Services and Software > Databases**.
   1. Click on your {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} instance.  
      You are now on the **Service instance details** page where the CRN is displayed.
   
   After you log in to the {{site.data.keyword.netezza_short}} web console, you are on the home page.  
   If you leave your session idle in a web browser for 30 minutes, you are automatically logged out of the web console.

   Choose a light mode or dark mode for a better web console experience.
